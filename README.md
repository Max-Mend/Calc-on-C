# Calc-on-C
A simple calculator written in C.

For this project, I used two basic libraries:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <string.h>
```

The program uses a "while" loop to continuously read user input.
Input is handled using the "scanf" function â€” similar to how input works in Python with "input()".
